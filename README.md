# text-classifier-tensorflow
classify text as either positive, negative, or neutral (extra indifferent classification for scikit random forest model)

to use: run the classifier_website.py and open the local website (http://127.0.0.1:5000/)

If both models could not be loaded, make sure the absolute path for both model's file location is correct (the directory of text_classification_model for classifier_tensorflow_model.py AND .joblib files in the rfc_model for the three rfc components).
